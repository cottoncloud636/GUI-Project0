Created an abstract LinkedList class called CandleList.
Created two more LinkedList class which extend the CandleList. One is called UnsortedCandleList and one is called SortedCandleList.
Display both UnsortedCandleList and SortedCandleList on a GUI. If candle information is not complete, console out.
